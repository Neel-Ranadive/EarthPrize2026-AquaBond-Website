               Currently, our prototype is under development and testing phases. Our team plans to target the framework for the application to track patients' health, providing a more immersive experience for you, the user. Users will log in, scan their wound, and scan the QR code on each bandage. The app will take care of the rest, providing a comprehensive report in a matter of minutes that covers everything from symptoms to healing time. AquaBond will come in a kit model, including various molds, cross-linking solution, and a key for the pH monitor. The algae bandages are made in a mold that allows you to personalize the shape to your preference. Each band aid also has a QR code that you can scan to access the app and obtain the diagnosis. We plan on incorporating our own AI LLM Model to provide the reports of the user's various wounds as fast as possible.

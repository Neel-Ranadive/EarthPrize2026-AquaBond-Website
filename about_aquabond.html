        <p>Our prototype is currently in development as we speak. Our team plans to target the framework for the application to track patients health providing a more immersive experience for you, the user. The app is meant for users to log in and scan their wound and the QR Code on each bandage and then the app handles the rest, giving you a detailed report within minutes of everything from healing time, to symptoms and more. Our physical protoype the bandaids, come in a kit model. The Algae Bandaids come in a mold that you can customize the shape of the bandaid to fit to your likening and then each bandaid has a QR Code that you scan and log into the app and recieve the diagnosis. We plan on incorporating our own AI LLM Model to provide the reports of the user's various wounds as fast as possible. This is general portion about our prototype and we plan on improving it as we scale this from a product and project into a real company, impacting the daily lives of people. Stay tuned for updates to come forth soon!</p>

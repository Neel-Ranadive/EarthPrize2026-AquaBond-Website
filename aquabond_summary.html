        <p>AquaBond is a solution that was invented by Neestha Kapadia and expanded and further created with additional help from Nysa Vadaliya, Joseph Sangem, and Neel Ranadive.  The product features a 3D-printed mold that has a kit with the Algae Printed Bandages and the corresponding QR Code on each bandage which can be scanned to our sensor on our app that detects the wound, the healing time, the various healing methods and provides a detailed report of the wound. Patients log into the app with their saved login information and use the app's camera to scan their wound and QR code of the bandage to assess the wound and recieve their detailed summary of the wound within minutes. This bandage not only is beneficial for the consumers making use of it by reducing their exposure to PFAS chemicals, but is also good for their environment as every bandage is printed from Algaes like Spirulina and Chlorella Algae cells making them biodegradable and reducing the amount of toxic waste for the environment. This keeps our consumers healthy, and our world a cleaner and greener place. We are truly passionate about Aquabond and this is our product and business model. </p>

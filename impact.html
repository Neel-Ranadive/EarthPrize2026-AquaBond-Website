                    As the risk of dangerous chemicals, like PFAS, entering bloodstreams from water and open wounds increases, the result is an increased risk of cancers and decreased vaccine responses. This can be deducted by replacing PFAS in bandages with algae, creating a faster healing process in a sterile manner (Your Health & PFAS, 2024). Furthermore, it will provide easy access to patient logs and wounds through the app. The algae bandage revolutionizes injury treatment as the user can simply use the app to check the bandage color revealing the time till the injury has healed. Additionally, the doctor can simply check a scan log to see the patients progress. Removal of the PFAS content from bandages and implementing algae bandages will help to prevent thousands of casualties, thus improving technology while making our community a safer place for future generations.

                    AquaBond provides a safer alternative for both humans and the environment by being 100% biodegradable, using algae cells, CaCl₂, and glycerin to ensure the wound stays clean without harsh chemicals. In the bandages which were found positive for PFAS, it was shown that the chemicals were mainly on the adhesive flaps and the cotton pad, which comes into direct contact with open wounds. Instead, our adhesive replicates the Tokay Gecko’s arrow-like formation of setae on their feet. This design creates a natural suction onto skin with microscopic holes to ensure the wound gets oxygen and the hydrogel retains moisture.

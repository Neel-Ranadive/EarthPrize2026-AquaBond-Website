        <p>For Aquabond, it is not just about creating a product, it is about revolutionizing a product for the greater good of humanity. With Aquabond we plan on making a global impact in the lives of everyone. From a surgeon or a healthcare professional to a young child or parent, everyone can use Aquabond and be able to access it. The reason behind this is because Aquabond targets a critical yet unnoticed issue in the healtchare industry, the use of PFAS in bandages. You may not notice it, but every time you put a bandage you are exposing yourself to the potential unseen dangers of PFAS like Cancers, Development Issues, Fertility Issues, Thyroid and Liver Complications and more. With Aquabond we want to make bandaids that still heal wounds but without the risk of PFAS, but instead being made from Algaes like Spriulina and Chlorella Algae. These bandages are also biodegradeable. So with Aquabond we not only plan to impact something short term, but long term by revolutizining the healthcare industry, positively impacting people's everyday lives, and making our world a more cleaner and greener place to live in. </p>

            <h2>About Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                We are a student-led team from the Morris County School of Technology committed to creating sustainable healthcare
                solutions. Aquabond was founded and developed by Neestha Kapadia, Nysa Vadaliya, Joseph Sangem, and Neel Ranadive.
                AquaBond focuses on PFAS-free wound care that protects both
                people and the environment while increasing global accessibility.

        <h2>What Is the Problem?</h2>
        <p>
        According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 97% of Americans have PFAS in their blood. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), consisting of 12,000 unique chemicals, is linked with major health risks, like 6,800 annual cases of kidney and testicular cancers from contaminated drinking water. Our project focuses on a growing issue in our community: the overuse and waste of non-biodegradable and PFAS bandages. 65% of standard bandages contain these “forever chemicals”, which cannot break down and remain in the body (Kuzub, 2025). Algae-made bandages provide a biodegradable, PFAS-free option that will reduce the 16,680 tonnes of biohazardous waste created from wound coverings annually. 
        Kuzub, A. (2025). Report says Band-Aids contain PFAS, the forever chemicals. Many small exposures can add up to a big exposure, environmental experts warn. Northeastern Global News. https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/04/09/band-aid-pfas-forever-chemicals/

        </p>
    
        <h3>Who Is Being Affected?</h3>
        <p>
           PFAS have become an increasing concern in the United States, with more than 150 million Americans having these ‘forever chemicals’ detected in their drinking water. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances contaminate water through industrial and medical waste, and have been linked to various health conditions such as kidney cancers, reduced vaccine effectiveness, and liver damage.

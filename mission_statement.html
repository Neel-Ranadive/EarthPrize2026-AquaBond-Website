        <p>Everyday, 40 million people suffer from chronic wounds, with regions like the Sub-Saharan having infection risks reaching 18% from the lack of hygienic care. WIth Aquabond, our mission is to break restricted access to proper aid and reduce the environmental impact of PFAS/forever chemicals from 65% of bandages worldwide. PFAS may be effective, but harmful, as prolonged exposure to PFAS can bring on various cancers, fertility and developmental issues, thyroid and liver issues, and more. With Aquabond, we want to stop this exposure, by making our bandages made from natural algaes like Spirulina and Cholerlla Algae. These materials of our bandaids do the same if not better than what PFAS can do. Additionally, our bandaids are biodegradable, so after usage, they don't create a pile of toxic waste but degrade into the environment over time. So, our mission not only aims to stop people running the risk of various infections, but revolutinize the healthcare industry, change the daily lives of people for the good, and make our environment a safer and better place to live. So join Aquabond on our mission, not just as consumers but as partners and advocates.  </p>

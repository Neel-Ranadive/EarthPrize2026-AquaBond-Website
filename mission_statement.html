                    Everyday, 40 million people suffer from chronic wounds, with regions like the Sub-Saharan having infection risks reaching 18% from the lack of hygienic care. Our mission is to break restricted access to proper aid and reduce the environmental impact of PFAS/forever chemicals from 65% of bandages worldwide. PFAS may be effective, but harmful, as prolonged exposure to PFAS can bring on various diseases, such as infertility, fetal developmental issues, thyroid and liver cancers. With AquaBond, we want to stop this exposure, by making our bandages made from natural algaes like Spirulina and Chlorella Algae. These algae have also been proven to reduce healing time by 40%. Additionally, our bandages are biodegradable, so after usage, they don't create a pile of toxic waste but degrade into the environment over time. So, our mission not only aims to stop people running the risk of various infections, but revolutionize the healthcare industry, change the daily lives of people for the good, and make our environment a safer and better place to live. So join AquaBond, not just as consumers, but as partners and advocates to create better health for a better tomorrow.
